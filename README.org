* lazy-emacs

*** Keep in mind that this project is my attempt to learn elisp.

Another configuriation system where everything file and feature is lazy loaded
(even the themes).

** Currently themes available

1. cyberpunk
2. monokai-alt
3. monokai
4. spacemacs-light
5. spacemacs-dark

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(lazy-emacs/load-theme 'cyberpunk)
(lazy-emacs/load-theme 'monokai-alt)
(lazy-emacs/load-theme 'monokai)
(lazy-emacs/load-theme 'spacemacs-light "spacemacs" 'spacemacs-common)
(lazy-emacs/load-theme 'spacemacs-dark "spacemacs" 'spacemacs-common)
#+END_SRC

** Notes

- The only packages that aren't submodules of git (the where found on elpa) are:
  - paredit
  - undo-tree
  - seq
  - queue
  - tex-site (AKA auctex)

- In order to load a new submodule to the packages subdirectory run:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
git submodule add -b master "git-url" "packages/package-name"
#+END_SRC
